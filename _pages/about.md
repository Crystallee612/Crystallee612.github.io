I currently work as a staff research scientist at [Visa Research](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research.html). I received my Ph.D. in Information Sciences and Technology at Pennsylvania State Univerity in 2022, and B.S. in Computer Science from University of Electronic Sciences and Tehcnology of China in 2017. My research interests intersect Deep Learning, Graph Representation Learning and AI Security. At Visa, my expertise is channeled towards advancing graph learning methodologies, deep tabular learning, and model explainability techniques. These endeavors are meticulously tailored to address complex, real-world financial scenarios.
